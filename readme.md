## About
Welcome to my portfolio website powered by Notion!

## Getting Started
If you want to get started with this project, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

yarn install
yarn dev

Make sure to also change the sit.config.ts file to your own Notion page! Specifically the rootNotionPageId and navigationLinks to use your own Notion pages.



## Postface
This website was done through the [Next.js Notion Starter Kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit). Feel free to check out the original code!

I was inspired by [Stephen Wu](https://wustep.me/) who showed my the Next.js Notion Starter Kit so I'd also like to thank him!
